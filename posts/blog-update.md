# hey guys i made a thing!!

(also this blog serves as a test so i can know if its working or not :P)

## some jsx code:
```jsx

import React from "react";

const CoolComponent = () => <div>I'm a cool component!!</div>;

export default CoolComponent;

```

# some TeX formatting:

Lift (\\( L \\)) can be determined by Lift Coefficient (\\(C_L\\)) like the following equation.

\\[ L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L \\]

For a right triangle \\(\Delta\\)ABC with side lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):
\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\]
