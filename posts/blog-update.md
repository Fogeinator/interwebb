# hey guys i made a thing!! 

now the upcoming blogs can have these stuffs inside them woohoo!!
(also this blog serves as a test so i can know if its working or not :P)

## some jsx code:
```jsx

import React from "react";

const CoolComponent = () => <div>I'm a cool component!!</div>;

export default CoolComponent;

```

# some TeX formatting:

Lift (\\( L \\)) can be determined by Lift Coefficient (\\(C_L\\)) like the following equation.

\\[ L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L \\]


For a right triangle \\(\Delta\\)ABC with side lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):

\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\]


A cute little fact about \\(\phi\\), the golden ratio: 

If \\(a_{1} = 1\\) and \\(a_{n+1} = 1 + \frac{1}{a(n)}\\), 

then when \\(n\\) gets super super big (\\(\infty\\)),
\\[a_n  = 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{...}}} 
        = 1+ \frac{1}{a_n}
\\]

\\[ a_n^2 - a_n - 1 = 0 \\]
\\[ a_n = \frac{1\pm\sqrt{5}}{2} = \phi \\]
